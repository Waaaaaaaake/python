'''
Given a number, create a function that returns a new number based on these rules:

For each digit, replace it by the number of times it appears in the number.
The final instance of the number will be an integer, not as a string.

digit_count(136116) âžž 312332
# The number 1 appears thrice, so replace all 1s with 3s.
# The number 3 appears only once, so replace all 3s with 1s.
# The number 6 appears twice, so replace all 6s with 2s.
# Return as an integer.
