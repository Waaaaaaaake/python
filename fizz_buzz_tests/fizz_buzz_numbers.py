The Fizz Buzz test is a poplular interview question used to help filter out the
99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program
their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that returns a list of all the numbers
from 1 to an integer argument.
But for multiples of three use “Fizz” instead of the number
and for the multiples of five use “Buzz”. For numbers which are
multiples of both three and five use “FizzBuzz”.
